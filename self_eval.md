# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

When you need one of multiple possible outcomes to occur based on a given value. This is required in any program
designed to deliver more than one possible output, which is the great majority of programs. Accordingly, conditionals
are one of the fundamenal control architechtures every robust programming language must support.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would have started it earlier in the day.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

I was satisfied to find that most of my knowledge of JavaScript carried over when completing the basic Ruby
tasks outlined in the exercises. For the most part, I was able to intuit what operators to use instead of 
having to look them up on ruby-docs, which bodes well for my future efforts in Ruby.
